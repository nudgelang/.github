> Building the future of AI agent development tools and languages

## üéØ Our Mission

NudgeLang is an organization dedicated to creating innovative tools and languages that make AI development more accessible, efficient, and powerful. We're building a suite of complementary technologies that work together to enable developers to create sophisticated AI applications with ease.

## üöÄ Our Projects

### [NudgeLang0](https://github.com/nudgelang/nudgelang0)
A declarative language designed for crafting sophisticated prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a structured, modular, and reusable approach to prompt engineering, incorporating advanced techniques and best practices in the field.

Key features:
- Declarative syntax for clear, readable prompts
- Built-in support for advanced techniques (CoT, ToT, ReAct)
- Type system for improved safety
- Dynamic content generation
- Structured output specification

### [Liath](https://github.com/nudgelang/liath)
An AI-powered database system that combines key-value storage, vector search, and AI capabilities into one flexible platform. Built on RocksDB/LevelDB with Lua as its query language.

Key features:
- Pluggable storage (RocksDB/LevelDB)
- Lua query language
- Vector search capabilities
- AI integration
- Built-in file operations
- Namespace isolation

### [Liath-rs](https://github.com/nudgelang/liath-rs)
A high-performance Rust implementation of Liath, focusing on speed and efficiency while maintaining the same powerful features.

Key features:
- Multi-threaded column families
- GPU acceleration support
- Async runtime with Tokio
- Integrated LLM inference using Candle
- Vector embeddings with FastEmbed
- Similarity search powered by USearch

## üéØ Project Synergy

1. **NudgeLang0** provides the language for crafting sophisticated AI prompts
2. **Liath** offers the database infrastructure for storing and retrieving AI-generated content
3. **Liath-rs** delivers high-performance implementations for production environments

Together, they form a complete ecosystem for building AI-powered agents and applications.
